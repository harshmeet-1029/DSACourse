The Space complexity is the the space it take in the system ( IN SIMPLE WORDS it is the memory required by the program to execute a program and produce output )

we use BIG O notation to find it 
we use O(n),O(n2),O(n log n)


For any Alog memory is reuired for the following purpose 
1. To store the program instructions 
2. To store constant values
3. To store variable values.
4. and few others things like function calls, jumping statementsetc..

it is the combination of 

Auxiliary space  => Space that we take to solve the problem 
	+
input space => Space that we take to solve the input 

a -> input space -> Becuase we are taking it as input
b -> input space -> Becuase we are taking it as input
c -> Auxiliary space because we are using extra space to solve a problem 
c = a+b

if i am using arr[n]  that means i am using O(n) space 


#Examples of O(1)
function add(n1,n2){
sum = n1+n2
return sum
}

Over here n1 will take 4 bytes 
n2 will take 4 bytes 
and sum will take 4 bytes 
so no matter what will be the input the memory it will take will be 16 bytes only so it is O(1)

--------------------
#Examples of O(N) Linear space complexity
function sumOfNumbers(arr[],N){
sum=0
for (i=0 to N){
sum = sum+arr[i]
}
print(sum)
}

N*4bytes arr size
sum = 0 -> const 4 bytes
i -> 4 bytes
aux -> 4bytes
total = O(N)
